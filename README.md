# game-of-life

##About

The Game of Life is set in an infinite two-dimensional grid inhabited by “cells”. Every cell interacts with up to eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

##Scenarios

From an initial seed grid the game "evolves" one iteration at a time. An iteration applies rules to the grid to determine its next state. These scenarios are:

0.Scenario: No interactions 
-Given a game of life 
-When there are no live cells
-Then on the next step there are still no live cells
